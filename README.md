👋 Hi, I’m Jan!

- 🌱 I'm a Python Software Engineer. If I'm not programming in Python, I dabble in SQL, Rust, and R. 
  I like to automate away all the things which are annoying to do manually but are important to produce great software.
- 💪 I've done a lot of data engineering work: I code reproducable and tested data pipelines with 
  data models stakeholders can trust to make decisions upon.
- 💞️ I like to tinker with my linux environment :-)
- 📫 You can reach me via mail in English or German
